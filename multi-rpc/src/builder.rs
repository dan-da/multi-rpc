//! This module provides the `ServerBuilder` for configuring and launching multiple RPC servers
//! from a single service implementation.
//!
//! When you use `multi-rpc`, your single service object is shared across all the different
//! protocol servers you enable (e.g., tarpc, REST, jsonrpsee). To make this safe and efficient,
//! we rely on two key synchronization primitives: `Arc` and `Mutex`.
//!
//! # `Arc` for Shared Ownership
//! The `std::sync::Arc` (Atomically Reference Counted) enables your single service instance to be
//! owned by multiple server tasks simultaneously. When you launch a server for a protocol, it
//! receives a clone of the `Arc`, giving it a reference to the same underlying service. This
//! prevents the need to duplicate your service's state for each server and ensures all requests
//! are handled by the same, consistent logic.
//!
//! # `Mutex` for Thread-Safe Access
//! The `tokio::sync::Mutex` provides exclusive, thread-safe access to your service object.
//! While `Arc` allows multiple threads to own a reference, it doesn't prevent them from
//! trying to modify the data at the same time. The `Mutex` ensures that only one server
//! task can access or modify the service's state at any given moment. This is crucial for
//! methods that take `&mut self` as it prevents data races and keeps your application's
//! state consistent. We use the `tokio` version of `Mutex` because it works seamlessly
//! with asynchronous code, allowing locks to be held across `.await` points without blocking
//! the entire thread.
//!
//! # Using `ServerBuilder`
//! You use the `ServerBuilder` to set up your server:
//! 1. Create a new builder with your service object.
//! 2. Use `add_protocol` to specify the protocols and network addresses for each server you want to run.
//! 3. Call `build()` to create the servers.
//! 4. Finally, call `run()` on the resulting `ServerRunner` to start listening for requests.
